# ProjectWeek2DS

In this project we were ask to find a fit for purpose basic Classifier model for the MNIST dataset.

# Tools

Python3 in a Jupyter Notebook

# Content

ProjectWeek2.ipynb - In this notebook MNIST data was ingested and fit for purpose classifier was found

MNIST_data.zip 1. MNIST_train.csv - a subset of the MNIST data used for training with both image and labels
               2. MNIST_test.csv - a subset of the MNIST data used for testing with both image and labels 
               
# Result

Due to the added variable and hence the increase in precision relative the accuracy observed made the choice for the Non-Naive Gaussian Bayes Classifier, an easy one.
